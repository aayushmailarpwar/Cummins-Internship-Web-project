# Cummins-Internship-Web-project
This was a 2 week short project in order to get some experience in Web Development using Angular as the FrontEnd, Python Lambda as backend and connected to an SQL for all data input. I was given a task to make a reusable, efficient and compact piece of code that would allow drop down menus to "Select All."

The four files in the Repo:
1) Cummins MCR Demo - short video showing the output UI. This is in production as of now in the newest iteration of MCR.
2) Intern Presentation - short ppt with all that I did during the 3 month internship
3) Internship Work Report - long report submitted for internship class to Purdue School of Engineering, IUPUI for credit. Much more detailed version of my work.
4) Status-SelectAll-Documentation - Documentation including code snips, comments, before and after change, and step by step procedure to implement the code.
